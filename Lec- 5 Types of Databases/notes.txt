Types of Databases:
In this lecture, we'll get a brief overview of the various types of databases commonly used in different applications:

Relational Database:

Most widely used database type.
Stores data using tables with rows and columns.
Examples: MySQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server.

NoSQL Database:

Stands for "Not only SQL".
Stores data in key-value pairs, similar to a hashmap.
Best for handling unstructured data.
Example: MongoDB.

Object-Oriented Database:

Stores data in the form of objects (like in object-oriented programming).
Useful for scientific simulations and applications needing object storage.

In-Memory Database:

Data is stored in primary memory (RAM) for fast access.
Great for applications requiring low latency.

Time-Series Database:

Optimized for storing time-stamped data like stock prices or sensor readings.

Spatial Database:

Designed to store geometric shapes and spatial data (e.g., maps, GPS data).

Multimedia Database:

Used to store multimedia content such as text, images, and videos.

Columnar Database:

Stores data in columns rather than rows, which improves query performance for large datasets.

XML Database:

Data is stored in XML format, useful for applications that need to work with XML data.

NewSQL Database:

Aims to bridge the gap between traditional SQL databases and NoSQL databases.
Combines the scalability of NoSQL with the ACID properties of relational databases.

Blockchain Database:

Stores data in blocks linked together to form a secure, immutable chain.

Key Details:

Relational Database:

Data is stored in tables with predefined relationships between them.
Allows for complex data manipulation and querying.

NoSQL Database:

Created to handle data that doesn't fit into the rigid structure of relational databases.

Object-Oriented Database:

Useful in situations requiring data to be stored as objects, especially in scientific and engineering simulations.

In-Memory Database:

Stores data in RAM, making it ideal for use cases where speed is crucial, like real-time analytics.
