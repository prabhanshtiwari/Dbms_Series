Data Independence:
    - At any level, if there is any change, it won't affect the other levels

Logical Data Indeoendence:
    - If any change is done at logical level, it won't affect view level
    - Eg: If we are making any changes in database, like adding new column, it won't affect the view level.


Physical Data Independence:
    - If any change is done at physical level, it won't affect the logical level.
    - Eg: If we are moving from hard-disk to cloud storage, the logical level is not affected
