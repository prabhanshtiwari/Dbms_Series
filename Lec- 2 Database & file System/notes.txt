Database: collection of inter-related Database

Wife and husband is related with marriage databbase

student and teacher is related because of college, school database

File System: it is OS approach for storing and organising data using files and folders

File System acts as interface between data and user

Disadvantages of file System
    1. Data Redundancy: Repetation of data
    Eg: Data stored in registers of schools and college
        name and roll no are repeated

    2. Poor memory utilization:

    3. Data Inconsistency:
    Eg: Making change in one register but not in others
    now, the age of one register is updated while other register do not contain updated data
    Now, it leads to Inconsistency that which age is correct

    4. Data Security: top most priority
    Eg: to restrict usage of data by someone else
